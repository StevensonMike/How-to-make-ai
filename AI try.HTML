<h1>Step 1: Data Collection</h1>
<p>Collect and aggregate text data from various sources</p>

<h2>Step 2: Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Perform pre-processing tasks such as removing irrelevant information, normalizing text, handling special characters or symbols, and splitting into smaller units (tokens or sentences)</p>

<h2>Step 3: Model Architecture</h2>
<p>Define the deep neural network architecture using transformers, e.g., the GPT-2 model from huggingface transformers library</p>

<h2>Step 4: Training</h2>
<p>Train the model using the preprocessed data</p>
<p>Adjust the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and desired output</p>

<h2>Step 5: Language Generation</h2>
<p>Pass a prompt or question to the trained model</p>
<p>Generate human-like text by predicting the most likely next words or sequence of words based on the learned patterns</p>

<h2>Step 6: Iterative Refinement</h2>
<p>Reiterate the training process by evaluating the model's performance</p>
<p>Fine-tune the model through multiple iterations to improve language generation capabilities and overall performance</p>

<h2>Step 7: Deployment</h2>
<p>Deploy the final trained model as an interactive AI assistant, capable of providing coherent and contextually relevant responses to user inputs</p>
